Hello. This is an automated message from the Salt & Pepper Crew in Granblue Fantasy. As you know, we expect people in the crew to participate in the Discord, as that is our goal as a gaming community.
If your inactivity is only temporary and you expect to resume activity, please let your crew captain know. 
If you are done with the game, or are not interested in actively participating in our Discord community, then we would prefer to part ways.
If you don't reply, we will assume the latter and you will be removed from the crew and discord after 3 days.

Thanks!
